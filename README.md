## Dive into Dart's patterns and records by John Ryan, Marya Belanger

This codelab creates an application that displays a JSON document in Flutter. The application simulates JSON coming from an external source. The JSON contains document data such as the modification date, title, headers, and paragraphs. You write code to neatly pack data into records so that it can be transferred and unpacked wherever your Flutter widgets need it.

You then use patterns to build the appropriate widget when the value matches that pattern. You also see how to use patterns to destructure data into local variables.

## Building next generation UIs in Flutter By Brett Morgan

You'll build the initial menu page for a post apocalyptic sci-fi themed game. There is a title with a fragment shader that samples the text to visually animate it, a difficulty menu that changes the color theme of the page with animations galore, and an animated orb painted with a second fragment shader. If that isn't enough, at the end of the codelab you'll add a subtle particle effect to bring movement and interest to the page.
